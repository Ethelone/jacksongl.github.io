<h4>Runtime Type Check for Built-in Functions</h4>
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. While is OK to assign different types of values to the same variable or defined functions with arbitrary parameters during the execution, most JavaScript built-in functions (e.g., <tt>String.prototype.indexOf</tt> etc.) are defined with valid parameter type. However, it is generally hard to precisely infer the type of a value via static analysis. Building a runtime type checker for those standard built-in functions can hopefully help pinpoint potential problems.<br>
For illustration, this demo analysis only checks <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/localeCompare">String.prototype.localeCompare</a> function, a relatively more complete runtime checker is available as <a href="https://github.com/Berkeley-Correctness-Group/DLint/tree/master/src/js/analyses/dlint/jsBuiltinFunctionChecker">analyses</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/Berkeley-Correctness-Group/DLint">DLint probject</a>.
