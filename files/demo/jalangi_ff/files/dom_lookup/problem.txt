<h4>Redundant DOM Lookup</h4>
<p>
Most of the types of tasks we need to do in on-page scripts consists of 1) lookup the DOM element 2) perform some tasks on the DOM element.
Finding DOM elements is one of the performance bottlenecks of in-browser JavaScript.
Reduce the unnecessary DOM element lookup can hopefully give us a runtime speed up.
