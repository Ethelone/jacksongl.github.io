<h4>Detect for-in over Arrays</h4>
<p>
JavaScript provides different kinds of loops, including the
for-in loop, which iterates over the properties of an object.
For-in loops are useful in some contexts, but developers are
discouraged from using for-in loops to iterator over arrays.
The rationale for this rule is manifold. For illustration, consider
the following example, which is supposed to print <tt>66</tt>
</p>
<p>
First, because for-in considers all properties of an object, including
properties inherited from an object's prototype, the
iteration may accidentally include enumerable properties of
<tt>Array.prototype</tt>. E.g., suppose a third-party library expands
arrays by adding a method: <tt>Array.prototype.m = ...;</tt>. 
In this case, the example prints <tt>66function() {...}</tt>. 
Some browsers, e.g., Internet Explorer 7, mistakenly
iterate over all built-in methods of arrays, causing
unexpected behavior even if Array.prototype is not explicitly
expanded. Second, some developers may incorrectly
assume that a for-in loop over an array iterates through the
array's elements, similar to, e.g., the for-each construct in
Java. In this case, a developer would replace the loop body
from above with <tt>sum += x</tt>, which leads to the unexpected
output <tt>0012</tt>. Finally, a for-in loop is significantly slower
than a traditional for loop for array objects, and should be
avoided for performance reasons even if the other problems
are ruled out.
