<h4>An Empty Analysis Template</h4>
<p>
	This is an empty analysis template, containing all APIs of Jalangi. Try adding statements in those empty functions (hooks) to see what you can do with Jalangi.
	Note that there are two set of APIs of Jalangi, <tt><a href="https://github.com/SRA-SiliconValley/jalangi/blob/master/docs/analysis.md">Analysis</a></tt> and <tt><a href="https://github.com/SRA-SiliconValley/jalangi/blob/master/docs/analysis2.md">Analysis2</a></tt>.
	Those APIs are almost the same, except a few differences: </br>
	1. Analysis supports record and replay on Node.js.</br>
	2. Analysis2 is cleaner: In <tt>Analysis2</tt>, return a value only if you need to change the operation's result, while in <tt>Analysis</tt> returning a value is mandatory.</br>
	That means <tt>Analysis</tt> has more capabilities, while <tt>Analysis2</tt> is cleaner and more efficient.
</p>
<p>
	<b>All examples in this demo page use the first set of API.</b> Mainly because this demo page was build before <tt>Analysis2</tt> was created.
	Knowing one set of API, you can easily transfer to another API without much effort, since they are almost the same.
</p>
<p>
You can also use this demo page to <b>quickly prototype and test</b> an dynamic analysis in your mind, especially when you are unsure about its feasibility.
