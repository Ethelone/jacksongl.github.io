<h4>Confusing URL</h4>
<p>
At a quick glance, many people might believe the following URL is linking to <tt>www.google.com</tt>, but if you are using Firefox and click the following link, you will be directed to <tt>www.bing.com</tt> <br/>
<a href="http://www.google.com&search_query=ras+bodik+computer+scneince+164&q=test@www.bing.com/search?q=berkeley&qs=n&form=QBLH&pq=berkeley&sc=8-8&sp=-1&sk=&cvid=09f4184817cb4850a70342ae9b3b072d">
http://www.google.com&search_query=ras+bodik+computer+scneince+164&q=test@www.bing.com/search?q=berkeley&qs=n&form=QBLH&pq=berkeley&sc=8-8&sp=-1&sk=&cvid=09f4184817cb4850a70342ae9b3b072d
</a>

<p>
The syntax of a fully qualified absolute URL is as follows: <tt><tt>protocol:</tt><tt>//</tt><tt>login:password@</tt><tt>address</tt><tt>:port</tt>...</tt><br/>
The sub-string before the <tt>@</tt> character and after the indicator of a hierarchical URL (<tt>//</tt>) is parsed as credentials to access the resource.
Consequently, <tt>www.google.com</tt> in the link is parsed as the login name rather than the destination. 
This @-based trick is often used as a technique of online fraud targeted at casual users.
