<h4>Detecting Cross-browser Issues</h4>
<p>
Another simple but powerful analysis that can be built 
on top of Jalangi is checking the cross-browser 
compatibility issues of web applications.
It is well known that when developing a website, it is
difficult and painful to support all web browsers because
each browsers has their own implementations of the DOM,
JavaScript and CSS standard which could lead to very serious
issues.
</p>
<p>
The reasons for JavaScript incompatibility are many-fold:
First, specifications can sometimes be poorly written, have
ambiguity. Second, some part of the specification is hard to
implement because of backwards compatibility issues. And
lastly, browser vendors sometimes sacrifice correctness for
interoperability and politics. Some browsers do not consider
the standard a priority to implement the DOM tree interfaces
correctly (or even fully, for that matter). As a result,
to have a cross-browser website, web developers have to
check all of the website's pages and JavaScript operations
in various browsers the visitors might use.
Just running our analysis module and framework on Firefox,
we can detect those compatibility issues on all browser
platforms.
</p>
<p>
To implement this analysis application, we first search for
reported compatibility issues on the Internet and organized
a list of specifically for JavaScript DOM model.
For example, <tt>x.compareDocumentPosition(y)</tt> method gives
the relative place of one element <tt>y</tt> compared to element <tt>x</tt>
by comparing the document (DOM) positions of those elements.
However, this method is not supported by Internet Explorer
5.5, 6, 7, and 8.
