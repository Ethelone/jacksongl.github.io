<h4>Do Not Call setInterval with Too Small Interval</h4>
Time resolution on Windows systems is 15 milliseconds, meaning that it will interpret a time delay of 15 as either 0 or 15, depending on when the system
time was last updated. Setting timer delays of less than 15 can cause browser locking in Internet Explorer, so the smallest recommended delay is 
25 milliseconds to ensure a delay of at least 15 milliseconds.
