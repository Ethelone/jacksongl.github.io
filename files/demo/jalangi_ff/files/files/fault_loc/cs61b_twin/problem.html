Fill in the twin() method in the SList class so that it performs as indicated
in the comment.  Your solution should not use arrays.

  /**
   *  twin() takes this list and doubles its length by replacing each node
   *  with two consecutive nodes referencing the same item.
   *
   *  For example, if the input list is [ 3 7 4 2 2 ], the
   *  output list is [ 3 3 7 7 4 4 2 2 2 2 ].
   *
   *  IMPORTANT:  Do not try to make new copies of the items themselves.
   *  Make new SListNodes, but just copy the references to the items.
