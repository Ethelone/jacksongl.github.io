Fill in the smoosh() method in the Homework3 class so that it performs as
indicated in the comment.  Your solution should not use linked lists, nor
should it use your squish() method.

  /**
   *  smoosh() takes an array of ints.  On completion the array contains
   *  the same numbers, but wherever the array had two or more consecutive
   *  duplicate numbers, they are replaced by one copy of the number.  Hence,
   *  after smoosh() is done, no two consecutive numbers in the array are the
   *  same.
   *
   *  Any unused elements at the end of the array are set to -1.
   *
   *  For example, if the input array is [ 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 3 3 3 1 1 0 ],
   *  it reads [ 0 1 0 3 1 0 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 ] after smoosh()
   *  completes.
   *
   *  @param ints the input array.
