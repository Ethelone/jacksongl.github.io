<h4>Changes to the "arguments" Object</h4>
The <tt>arguments</tt> object is an array-like built-in object corresponding to the arguments passed to a function. Programmer can refer to a function's arguments within the function by using the arguments object. This object contains an entry for each argument passed to the function. E.g., <tt>arguments[0]</tt> refers to function argument <tt>a</tt> in function <tt>f</tt>. Although the use of <tt>arguments</tt> provides flexibility in JavaScript programming, unncessary use of this dynamic feature adds more uncertainty to the code which is harder to be analyzed by compiler. There are numerous ways to use <tt>arguments</tt> that causes the function to be de-optimized.
