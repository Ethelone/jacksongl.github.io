<h4>Finding Operations with No Effect</h4>
<p>
Some program constructs or built-in objects in JavaScript syntactically allow operations that has no dynamic effect during program execution. This often leads to confusing and bugs.
For instance, in <tt>gbemu-part2.js</tt> file in Google Octane Benchmark. Statement <tt>decode64.length -= 1;</tt> intended to get a sub-string of string variable <tt>decode64</tt>.
However, this statement has no side effect.
The developer probably confuses this casting use on arrays with strings (if <tt>decode64</tt> is an array, the statement actually deletes the last element in the array).

This simple dynamic analysis module monitors every put field operation and checks after the operation if the property value equals the new value intended.
