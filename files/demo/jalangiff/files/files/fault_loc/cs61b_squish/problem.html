Fill in the squish() method in the SList class so that it performs as indicated
in the comment.  Your solution should not use arrays, nor should it use your
smoosh() method.  Do not change the prototype of the SList constructor or the
insertEnd method; our test software will call them.

  /**
   *  squish() takes this list and, wherever two or more consecutive items are
   *  equals(), it removes duplicate nodes so that only one consecutive copy
   *  remains.  Hence, no two consecutive items in this list are equals() upon
   *  completion of the procedure.
   *
   *  After squish() executes, the list may well be shorter than when squish()
   *  began.  No extra items are added to make up for those removed.
   *
   *  For example, if the input list is [ 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 3 3 3 1 1 0 ], the
   *  output list is [ 0 1 0 3 1 0 ].
   *
   *  IMPORTANT:  Be sure you use the equals() method, and not the "=="
   *  operator, to compare items.
