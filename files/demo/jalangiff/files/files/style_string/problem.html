<h4>Detect style Property as String</h4>
<p>
The <tt>style</tt> property of a HTML DOM element is an object that holds properties corresponding to the style values specified in the element markup.
However, with the following code snippet, we found the following interesting operations on <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/sites">craiglist</a> 
that tries to compare the style object with a string:
</p>
<tt>[iid: 26203006]: [object CSS2Properties] !== 100px</tt> <br/>
<tt>	 result: true"</tt> <br/>
<tt>[iid: 26203006]: [object CSS2Properties] !== auto</tt> <br/>
<tt>	 result: true"</tt> <br/>
</tt>
<p>
It seems like the developer consider the style as the string that is explicitly specified in the HTML markup and tries to determine if the
style is as expected by comparing it with the css style value string. However converting the style object into string ends up with string
<tt id='tt_1'><script>var regx = /function[ ]([^ ^\(]+)[ \(\)]*\{/; var result = document.body.style.constructor.toString().match(regx); if(result === null) {regx = /\[[^ ]+[ ]([^\]]+)\]/; result = document.body.style.constructor.toString().match(regx);} document.getElementById("tt_1").innerHTML = result[1];</script></tt>(in your current browser) which is meaningless to compare with.
</p>
