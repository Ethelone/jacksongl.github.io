In most major browsers, there is only a single process for executing JavaScript and responding user interface.
Consequently, a long running function in JavaScript prevents the UI from responding to user inputs. Making sure that your JavaScript takes less time to execute is important to improve the user experience.
<br/>
According to research study (Miller et al.), the total amount of time that a single JavaScript operation should take (at a maximum) is 100 milliseconds. The research shows that
if the user interface responds to user input within 100 milliseconds, the user feels that he is "directly manipulating the objects in the user interface."
